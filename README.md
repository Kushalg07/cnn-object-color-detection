# 🎨 A.I. Vision in Color: Object Detection with Color Extraction
## Object Detection with Color Recognition and Explainable AI

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an advanced object detection system built using:

- Faster R-CNN (ResNet50 + FPN backbone)
- Region Proposal Network (RPN)
- Color Extraction using K-Means Clustering
- Grad-CAM Explainability
- HOG Visualization

The system detects objects in images and simultaneously identifies their dominant color, providing enhanced image understanding.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional object detection models identify and localize objects but do not analyze object color.

This project extends object detection by integrating:

- Bounding box prediction
- Dominant color extraction
- Color naming (CSS3 matching)
- Model interpretability using Grad-CAM

This enables richer scene understanding for robotics, surveillance, autonomous systems, and AR applications.
